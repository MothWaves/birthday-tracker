# Birthday Tracker

A small birthday tracker that lists stored birthdays in order from closest to farthest away.

## Configuration
The program uses a json file called `config.json` for configuration, by default stored in the user's home directory under the directory: `.config/birthday-tracker/`

This directory can be changed by setting your desired configuration directory with the Environment Variable: `BIRTHDAY_TRACKER_CONFIG`

The config file currently only has one option `database_path`, which specifies the path to the birthday database json file. 

## Birthday Database
The Birthday Database is a json file which should specify an array of json objects, each of which should represent a birthday.

A birthday should specify a name, a day, a month and optionally a year, and have the following format:
```json
{
	"name": "Alex",
	"day": 8,
	"month": 5,
	"year": 1999
}
```
The "year" can also be null, if you don't want to specify the year of birth. If you don't specify the year of birth the program will not include the age the individual is turning on that birthday.
